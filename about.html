			<h1 style="margin: 1.5em;">So what is The Druid Collective?</h1>
			<p>
				Basically a group of artsy/nerdy/eclectic/smart(ish) people that like to hangout and do fun things. 
				Some people are into politics and community service, some are into print making and painting, some are into reading, and some are into DND.
				Currently we have about 30 active members. Social norms are generally optional, don't take yourself too serious.
			</p>
			<p>We generally try to be a place free of judgement and we accept all (yes all) beliefs and ways of life as long as you're not deleberately trying to be a pain</p>
			<p>We're designated by the university as a "Living Learning Community" which means as a member you can choose to live with other Druids in Blount hall (4th floor) and we would love to have you</p>
			<p>I'd describe it sorta like a counter cultural fraternity, or an anti-fraternity fraternity.</p>
			<p>If you're interested, join the discord and come to some events listed on our calendar, anyone is welcome to apply for membership via our application</p>
