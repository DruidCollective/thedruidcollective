This website was made by Rhett Applestone 2025. Hopefully I'm still alive.
If you're a new druid tasked with keeping the website up to date learn some html and css, and 
I used a bit of js to re-use the navbar.

Don't fucking throw away this website in favor of some un-maintainable piece of shit from a website-builder,
I spent some time on this mothafucka. I mean do what you want, if a job's gotta get done I feel ya.

The point of pure html and css is to make a simple website.

To edit this website get a good text editor and edit the files, then view the files
in some webbrowser to see what changes when you refresh. I like the micro text editor, there are others

If you're on windows coding is going to be much easier on linux, but you can still
use like an IDE or some shit.

you can ask me what things mean if you don't not html or css, I'm not hard to find usually.

to learn basic web shit use https://www.w3schools.com or like get a book on html css js
